    <h3> My Neighborhood</h3>
    <p>My neighborhood is a pretty cool place that's not that cool, honestly.
        That said, we have some nice local places I occasionally go to.
        There's this lovely little place called <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g57093-d10258717-Reviews-Antonella_s_Artisan_Bread_Cafe-Orem_Utah.html">Antonella's Cafe</a>
        that has good sandwiches and fresh bread. <br> There's also the <a href="https://oremlibrary.org/">Local Library</a>, which I'm rather fond of.
        The entrance has a strange modern architecture I'm not sure I like, but the back portion has these beautiful stained glass windows filled with many scenes and characters
        from famous stories, some real and some fictional.
